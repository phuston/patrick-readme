### Hi, I'm Patrick

#### What is my role?
I am a software engineer on the Shopping team at Shift. I seek to add value to the team and company by striking an appropriate balance between thinking critically about the *why*s of the things we build (and contributing to those decisions) and getting things done when they need to get done. As an engineer at a startup, I strive to be flexible in my work to align with team objectives and achieve breadth in my skills across engineering and design.

#### What am I responsible for?
I am responsible primarily for two things:

1. Learning as much as I can and investing in my learning. 
2. Adding positive value to the team and business.

#### How do I give and receive feedback?
I prefer to give and receive feedback directly. While I value positive feedback, it's not something that I require to work effectively. I'd rather hear

```
You're doing well in general, and here are a couple of things that would help you add even more value.
```

than

```
You're doing well, nothing to improve on!
```

I sometimes find it suspicious when there's nothing to improve on.

I am open to criticism over most mediums, though I prefer to also have some rationale and actionable things to work on in these situations. I find that I respond to feedback best when it's addressed as soon as it comes up. 

For more major feedback, a meeting face-to-face to talk and figure out a plan is something I appreciate. The uncertainty of tone/importance in some written feedback without any follow-up can be somethign that causes me some anxiety. 

#### Personal principles / values
In no specific order, here are some things that I value:

1. Independence & Responsibility    
2. Transparency
3. Camaraderie & fun

#### What are my strengths / what do I want to become great at?
My strengths include:

1. Understanding and managing complexity while maintaining awareness for the greater context. 
2. A general self-awareness of what my role is and how I can add value.
3. Some people think I'm a nice person.
4. Energy and excitement to tackle difficult problems.

I want to be great at all of these things, but I'd like to highlight two more: focus and motivation.
